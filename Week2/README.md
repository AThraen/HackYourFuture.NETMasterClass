### Homework
If you want your homework reviewed, you should create a repository under your own account and check in your solution in GitHub. 
Since we are working on the same project throughout the class, you don't need to create a separate repository for each week, simply make a project repository.
When you have committed your solution, let teacher/mentors know in slack and we will review it.
