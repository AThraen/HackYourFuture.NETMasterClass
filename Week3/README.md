# HackYourFuture .NET Masterclass - Week 3

Here you can find all the materials you will need for Week 3.

#### [Slides](Slides3.pdf)

#### [Exercises](Exercises3.md)

#### [Solution](Solution/ThirtyOne)
An example solution to the exercises if you get stuck or fall behind. Try to make your own solution first, following the instructions above.

#### Video
Video will come later.

### Homework
If you want your homework reviewed, you should create a repository under your own account and check in your solution in GitHub. 
Since we are working on the same project throughout the class, you don't need to create a separate repository for each week, simply make a project repository.
When you have committed your solution, let teacher/mentors know in slack and we will review it.
